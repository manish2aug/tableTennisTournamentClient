    <u><b>Points balance calculation</b></u><br>
    Let's say player A, plays against player B,C and D and the scores look like the following<br>
    <br>
    A vs B: 11-6, 11-3 (Winner: A)<br>
    A vs C: 6-11, 9-11 (Winner: C)<br>
    A vs D: 11-5, 10-12, 11-9 (Winner: A)<br>
    <br>
    <b>Points earned by player A</b><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= ((total points gained by A) - (total points gained opponents)) / total no of games played
    by A<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= ( (11 + 11 + 6 + 9 + 11 + 10 + 11) - (6 + 3 + 11 + 11 + 5 + 12 + 9))/7 <br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= (69 - 57)/7<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;= 1.714
